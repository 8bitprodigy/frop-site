<p>(Public Domain/CC0) 2025 Chris DeBoy</p>
<h2>Rationale:</h2>
<p>This is a license designed with the explicit intent to incentivise getting this code to be used in nuclear energy applications, by placing the code under a copyleft license, the terms of which are rendered void if the code is ever used in a nuclear setting.
That, and to poke fun at so-called &quot;FOSS&quot; licenses that include an anti-nuclear clause.</p>
