# Blargh

I'm Chris DeBoy, and I write code sometimes.  



I like C/C++, Nim, Ayn Rand, simple solutions/programs, permissive licenses, and game development.  



I dislike JavaScript, XML, socialism, copyleft licenses, cmake, and desktop programs built on any web technologies.  



If I could meet any famous person, alive or dead, I would pick Immanuel Kant so I could kill him personally.
