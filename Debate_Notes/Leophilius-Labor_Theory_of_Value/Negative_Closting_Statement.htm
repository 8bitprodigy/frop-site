<hr />
<p>This debate wasn’t just about labor. It was about <strong>value</strong> — what it is, where it comes from, and what kind of system honors it. My opponent tried to sell you a ghost: a metaphysical &quot;value&quot; created by labor, existing independently of anyone wanting the result. But value doesn’t exist in objects. It exists in <em>choice</em> — in the minds of individuals acting to sustain their lives.</p>
<p>My opponent has spent this entire debate <strong>smuggling in the very subjectivism he claims to oppose</strong>. He appeals to “socially necessary labor time” — but how is that determined? By the market. By prices. By what people value. His entire theory is a parasite on mine.</p>
<p>Even worse, every attempt to define or measure this “labor value” devolves into arbitrary guesswork or circular logic. How do you compare a surgeon’s work to a software engineer’s? How do you value art, software, or a 200-year-old bottle of whiskey? The labor theory of value cannot answer — unless it turns to subjective judgment.</p>
<p>The Subjective Theory of Value explains everything the labor theory can’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why prices fluctuate even when labor doesn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why clearance sales exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why a Picasso is worth millions and a copy isn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why a t-shirt with a logo costs 100x more than the same shirt without.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People don’t pay for labor — they pay for <em>results</em>. You don’t buy a sandwich because someone spent 45 minutes making it. You buy it because you're hungry, you think it will satisfy that hunger, and you like how it tastes.</p>
<p>And this isn’t just theoretical. The labor theory of value, when implemented, <strong>destroys prosperity</strong>. It punishes innovation by erasing rewards for increased efficiency. It disincentivizes risk-taking, entrepreneurship, and creativity. It hands moral credit to those who exert effort regardless of outcome — and condemns those who succeed in producing actual value.</p>
<p>Worse, it justifies coercion. If labor is the source of all value, then anyone who profits without labor must be a thief. That is how LTV leads — inexorably — to <strong>confiscation, redistribution, and tyranny</strong>.</p>
<p>But theft doesn’t become just by calling it “redistribution,” and slavery doesn’t become freedom by calling it “economic democracy.”</p>
<p>The moral root of this error is <strong>altruism</strong> — the idea that the individual's life and mind must be sacrificed to “society.” But a man’s life is not a means to another’s ends. You are not a beast of burden for the collective. And value — real, economic value — comes from <em>your</em> judgment, <em>your</em> work, and <em>your</em> choice to trade.</p>
<p>That’s the trader principle. That’s capitalism. And that’s the only system consistent with reason, with liberty, and with human flourishing.</p>
<p>The labor theory of value is not just false. It is a mystic relic of a pre-scientific age — a theory that tries to replace thought with toil, innovation with stagnation, and individual choice with collective decree.</p>
<p>The truth is simple: <strong>value is created by minds, not muscles.</strong> The man who invents a cure for cancer creates more value in a thought than a ditch-digger does in a lifetime. And no economic theory that denies that can survive contact with reality.</p>
