<h1>Cross-examination questions</h1>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Definitional and Foundational Questions</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>How exactly do you define &quot;socially necessary labor time&quot;? Who determines what's socially necessary?</li>
<li>How do you account for different skill levels and productivity between workers doing the same task?</li>
<li>If every efficiency improvement eventually becomes the new &quot;socially necessary&quot; standard, eliminating the innovator's advantage, why would anyone invest in R&amp;D or capital improvements instead of just copying competitors?</li>
<li>How do you measure labor time for complex goods requiring different types of specialized labor?
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Medical Surgery:</strong> If a heart surgery takes a surgeon 4 hours, an anesthesiologist 6 hours, and two nurses 8 hours each - is that 26 total labor hours? But the surgeon trained for 12 years while the nurses trained for 4. Do you multiply the surgeon's time by some skill factor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Movie Production:</strong> How do you measure the labor time in a Marvel movie? The director works 2 years, actors work 6 months, CGI artists work 18 months, and hundreds of crew work varying schedules. Do you just add up all the hours? How do you weigh A-list actor time versus grip time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smartphone Production:</strong> How do you compare the labor time of a silicon chip designer in California, a rare earth miner in Congo, a factory assembly worker in China, and a software developer in India? Do you average their hourly wages? Use raw time? How do you account for the designer's 8 years of education versus the miner's physical labor?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Subjective Value and Market Phenomena</strong></h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>Why do identical goods command different prices in different markets if labor content is the same?</li>
<li>How does your theory explain why a painting by Picasso sells for millions while an identical reproduction by an unknown artist sells for hundreds?</li>
<li>Why do some goods sell below their labor cost while others sell far above it?
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Movie Theater Popcorn:</strong> Movie theater popcorn costs $8 when the corn, oil, salt, and labor might only represent $0.50 in labor value. Meanwhile, a complex electronic device with hundreds of hours of R&amp;D and manufacturing labor might sell at a loss during clearance sales. How does this align with labor determining value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restaurant Meals:</strong> A simple pasta dish at a fancy restaurant costs $25, while an identical pasta dish at a diner costs $8. Same ingredients, same cooking time, same labor - but completely different prices based on ambiance, location, and brand. Which one reflects the &quot;true&quot;&quot; labor value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Designer vs Generic Clothing:</strong> A plain white t-shirt from Target costs $5, while an identical white t-shirt from Supreme costs $200. Same cotton, same manufacturing labor, same sewing time. The only difference is a logo. How does labor theory explain this 4000% price difference?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearance Sales:</strong> During clearance, stores sell complex manufactured goods - cars, electronics, furniture - at 50-70% off. These items didn't suddenly require less labor to produce. Why would they sell below their labor value?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you account for goods that require zero current labor but have high value (like rare minerals or antiques)?
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Raw diamonds found on the ground</strong> - Someone walks across a field, picks up a diamond, and sells it for $10,000. What labor created that value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aged whiskey</strong> - A bottle of 30-year-old Macallan costs $5,000. Most of that value came from time passing, not labor. The &quot;aging&quot; happened automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Antique furniture</strong> - A 200-year-old chair sells for $20,000. The original labor was centuries ago and minimal compared to the current price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural springs/water sources</strong> - Companies buy land with natural springs for millions. What labor created the value of the water source itself?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Austrian/Marginalist Challenges</strong></h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>Why does the same beer cost $8 at 3 PM but $4 at 6 PM during happy hour, when it contains identical labor content? Doesn't this prove that consumer demand and marginal utility - not labor time - actually determine market prices?</li>
<li>How does your theory explain why a rare baseball card sells for $100,000 when it required pennies worth of labor to produce?</li>
<li>Why do consumers choose between products based on their personal preferences rather than labor content?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Capital and Technology</strong></h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>How does your theory explain the value of pure information goods like software, databases, or digital content that can be copied infinitely at zero marginal labor cost?</li>
<li>When a database or algorithm becomes more accurate and valuable as it processes more data automatically, where does this increased value come from if no additional labor was performed?</li>
<li>When a startup's valuation jumps from $1 million to $1 billion overnight based on user growth or market potential - with no additional labor input - what labor created that $999 million in new value?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Market Dynamics</strong></h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>How does your theory explain speculative bubbles where prices diverge wildly from any conceivable labor content?</li>
<li>Why do businesses succeed or fail based on consumer satisfaction rather than efficient labor usage?</li>
<li>How do you account for seasonal price variations for identical goods?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Practical Application Problems</strong></h2>
<ol start="18">
<li>How would you implement labor-based pricing in a modern economy with millions of different goods and services?</li>
<li>What mechanism would determine the &quot;correct&quot; labor-based price when markets are eliminated?</li>
<li>How do you handle services where the value is entirely subjective (entertainment, therapy, art)?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Logical Consistency</strong></h2>
<ol start="21">
<li>If labor creates all value, why don't workers capture 100% of the value they create in market economies?</li>
<li>How can labor create value if the resulting product has no demand or utility to anyone?</li>
<li>Doesn't your theory create a circular definition where valuable labor is defined as labor that creates value?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>The Objectivist angle</strong></h2>
<ol start="24">
<li>
<p><strong>Rationalism vs. Empiricism:</strong> If value is objective and labor-determined, why does your theory require eliminating the very market processes through which humans actually demonstrate what they value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primacy of Existence:</strong> You claim value exists independent of human consciousness and choice - that goods possess &quot;true value&quot; based on labor content regardless of whether anyone wants them. Isn't this placing your theory above the observable facts of human action and preference?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concept Formation:</strong> What is your definition of &quot;labor&quot;? Does it include mental work, creative work, entrepreneurial planning? If a composer spends 10 minutes writing a melody that sells millions of copies, versus a ditch-digger working 10 hours, which labor creates more value and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Stolen Concept:</strong> You argue that capitalists extract &quot;surplus value&quot; from workers - but the very concept of &quot;surplus&quot; requires a standard of measurement. What standard are you using to determine the &quot;correct&quot; amount workers should receive, and by what right do you impose this standard on voluntary exchanges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arbitrary Authority/Subjectivism:</strong> You claim workers are &quot;exploited&quot; when paid less than the &quot;full value&quot; they create - but who determines this 'full value' other than the voluntary choices of market participants?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Foundational Challenge:</strong> By what standard do you judge the current distribution of wealth as unjust?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Authority Question:</strong> Who will determine &quot;socially necessary labor time&quot; in your system, and by what right? You've rejected individual choice through markets - so some human mind must decide what counts as &quot;necessary.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Concept of Value:</strong> What does it mean for something to have value if no conscious being values it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Trader Principle:</strong> If both parties benefit from voluntary exchange, where is the exploitation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Choice Challenge:</strong> If your system is truly better for workers, why does it require force to implement rather than voluntary adoption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Various:</strong></p>
<p>What is your definition of exploitation?</p>
<p>By what right do you declare some exchanges &quot;unfair&quot;?</p>
<p>What gives you the authority to override individual judgment about value?</p>
<p>How do you know what workers &quot;should&quot; be paid?</p>
<p>By what standard do you determine what is &quot;good&quot;?</p>
<p>Who owns the product of a mind?</p>
</li>
