# Cross-examination questions

---

## **Definitional and Foundational Questions**

1. How exactly do you define "socially necessary labor time"? Who determines what's socially necessary?
2. How do you account for different skill levels and productivity between workers doing the same task?
3. If every efficiency improvement eventually becomes the new "socially necessary" standard, eliminating the innovator's advantage, why would anyone invest in R&D or capital improvements instead of just copying competitors?
4. How do you measure labor time for complex goods requiring different types of specialized labor?
   - **Medical Surgery:** If a heart surgery takes a surgeon 4 hours, an anesthesiologist 6 hours, and two nurses 8 hours each - is that 26 total labor hours? But the surgeon trained for 12 years while the nurses trained for 4. Do you multiply the surgeon's time by some skill factor
   
   - **Movie Production:** How do you measure the labor time in a Marvel movie? The director works 2 years, actors work 6 months, CGI artists work 18 months, and hundreds of crew work varying schedules. Do you just add up all the hours? How do you weigh A-list actor time versus grip time?
   
   - **Smartphone Production:** How do you compare the labor time of a silicon chip designer in California, a rare earth miner in Congo, a factory assembly worker in China, and a software developer in India? Do you average their hourly wages? Use raw time? How do you account for the designer's 8 years of education versus the miner's physical labor?

## **Subjective Value and Market Phenomena**

5. Why do identical goods command different prices in different markets if labor content is the same?
6. How does your theory explain why a painting by Picasso sells for millions while an identical reproduction by an unknown artist sells for hundreds?
7. Why do some goods sell below their labor cost while others sell far above it?
   - **Movie Theater Popcorn:** Movie theater popcorn costs \$8 when the corn, oil, salt, and labor might only represent \$0.50 in labor value. Meanwhile, a complex electronic device with hundreds of hours of R&D and manufacturing labor might sell at a loss during clearance sales. How does this align with labor determining value?
   
   - **Restaurant Meals:** A simple pasta dish at a fancy restaurant costs \$25, while an identical pasta dish at a diner costs \$8. Same ingredients, same cooking time, same labor - but completely different prices based on ambiance, location, and brand. Which one reflects the "true"" labor value?
   
   - **Designer vs Generic Clothing:** A plain white t-shirt from Target costs \$5, while an identical white t-shirt from Supreme costs \$200. Same cotton, same manufacturing labor, same sewing time. The only difference is a logo. How does labor theory explain this 4000% price difference?
   
   - **Clearance Sales:** During clearance, stores sell complex manufactured goods - cars, electronics, furniture - at 50-70% off. These items didn't suddenly require less labor to produce. Why would they sell below their labor value?
8. How do you account for goods that require zero current labor but have high value (like rare minerals or antiques)?
   - **Raw diamonds found on the ground** - Someone walks across a field, picks up a diamond, and sells it for \$10,000. What labor created that value?
   
   - **Aged whiskey** - A bottle of 30-year-old Macallan costs \$5,000. Most of that value came from time passing, not labor. The "aging" happened automatically.
   
   - **Antique furniture** - A 200-year-old chair sells for \$20,000. The original labor was centuries ago and minimal compared to the current price.
   
   - **Natural springs/water sources** - Companies buy land with natural springs for millions. What labor created the value of the water source itself?

## **Austrian/Marginalist Challenges**

9. Why does the same beer cost \$8 at 3 PM but \$4 at 6 PM during happy hour, when it contains identical labor content? Doesn't this prove that consumer demand and marginal utility - not labor time - actually determine market prices?
10. How does your theory explain why a rare baseball card sells for $100,000 when it required pennies worth of labor to produce?
11. Why do consumers choose between products based on their personal preferences rather than labor content?

## **Capital and Technology**

12. How does your theory explain the value of pure information goods like software, databases, or digital content that can be copied infinitely at zero marginal labor cost?
13. When a database or algorithm becomes more accurate and valuable as it processes more data automatically, where does this increased value come from if no additional labor was performed?
14. When a startup's valuation jumps from $1 million to $1 billion overnight based on user growth or market potential - with no additional labor input - what labor created that $999 million in new value?

## **Market Dynamics**

15. How does your theory explain speculative bubbles where prices diverge wildly from any conceivable labor content?
16. Why do businesses succeed or fail based on consumer satisfaction rather than efficient labor usage?
17. How do you account for seasonal price variations for identical goods?

## **Practical Application Problems**

18. How would you implement labor-based pricing in a modern economy with millions of different goods and services?
19. What mechanism would determine the "correct" labor-based price when markets are eliminated?
20. How do you handle services where the value is entirely subjective (entertainment, therapy, art)?

## **Logical Consistency**

21. If labor creates all value, why don't workers capture 100% of the value they create in market economies?
22. How can labor create value if the resulting product has no demand or utility to anyone?
23. Doesn't your theory create a circular definition where valuable labor is defined as labor that creates value?

## **The Objectivist angle**

24. **Rationalism vs. Empiricism:** If value is objective and labor-determined, why does your theory require eliminating the very market processes through which humans actually demonstrate what they value?

25. **Primacy of Existence:** You claim value exists independent of human consciousness and choice - that goods possess "true value" based on labor content regardless of whether anyone wants them. Isn't this placing your theory above the observable facts of human action and preference?

26. **Concept Formation:** What is your definition of "labor"? Does it include mental work, creative work, entrepreneurial planning? If a composer spends 10 minutes writing a melody that sells millions of copies, versus a ditch-digger working 10 hours, which labor creates more value and why?

27. **The Stolen Concept:** You argue that capitalists extract "surplus value" from workers - but the very concept of "surplus" requires a standard of measurement. What standard are you using to determine the "correct" amount workers should receive, and by what right do you impose this standard on voluntary exchanges?

28. **Arbitrary Authority/Subjectivism:** You claim workers are "exploited" when paid less than the "full value" they create - but who determines this 'full value' other than the voluntary choices of market participants?
    
    

29.  **The Foundational Challenge:** By what standard do you judge the current distribution of wealth as unjust?

30. **The Authority Question:** Who will determine "socially necessary labor time" in your system, and by what right? You've rejected individual choice through markets - so some human mind must decide what counts as "necessary."

31. **The Concept of Value:** What does it mean for something to have value if no conscious being values it?

32. **The Trader Principle:** If both parties benefit from voluntary exchange, where is the exploitation?

33. **The Choice Challenge:** If your system is truly better for workers, why does it require force to implement rather than voluntary adoption?

34. **Various:** 
    
    What is your definition of exploitation?
    
    By what right do you declare some exchanges "unfair"?
    
    What gives you the authority to override individual judgment about value?
    
    How do you know what workers "should" be paid?
    
    By what standard do you determine what is "good"?
    
    Who owns the product of a mind?
